description: He watched over and protected her, he would even give his life for her.
  What he could not do was love her. When Michael was a homeless waif roaming New
  York's back alleys, he risked his life to save the life of another child, beautiful
  Starr Endicott. This act of devotion to a girl he worshiped from afar changed the
  course of his life forever, for Starr's grateful father sent him away to a fine
  school where Michael grew into a handsome, well-educated man of deep convictions.
  Then he returned to New York, intent on repaying his benefactor and helping the
  loyal street kids who had been his only family. But from the first moment he saw
  Starr again, he knew he was helplessly in love. Believing he could never be worthy
  of her, Michael vowed never to press his suit . . . until danger in the form of
  a vile, scheming suitor forced him to risk everything to save Starr once again.
